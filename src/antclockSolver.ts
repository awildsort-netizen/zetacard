/**
 * DEPRECATED: antclockSolver.ts (v1.0)
 * 
 * This file has been completely replaced by antclockSolverV2.ts
 * 
 * Summary of changes:
 * - v1.0 assumed two separate bulks (phys, shadow)
 * - Phase 2 refactored to single-bulk architecture (bulk)
 * - v2.0 simplifies to essential observables only
 * - Event detection now based on bulk field dynamics + placeholder for Phase 5 CF curvature
 * 
 * To use Antclock:
 * ```
 * import { antclockSimulate, defaultAntclockConfig } from './antclockSolverV2';
 * ```
